# Indicator Library

These are indicators I regularly use for different trading strategies. The strategies themselves are not included here, but if these indicators can be useful to you, feel free to use them according to the terms of the license.

They have all been tested on Linux and Mac OS X, with Python 3.11. The required libraries can be installed by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Each indicator is in a separate file for easier management, use or troubleshooting.

Nothing in this repository constitute investment advice. I am not an investment advisor and I make no guarantees about the correctness or accuracy of any of these indicators, either on their own or as part of any strategy. Use at your own risk.
